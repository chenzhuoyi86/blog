  This is a review of journal article titled "Identity Instrumentalized," which
  recounts an intriguing history of how computer scientist Woodrow Wilson
  Bledsoe and his Panoramic Research Incorporated (PRI) laid down the
  foundational  works for computerized facial recognition algorithms using the
  funding from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) during  the 1960s United
  States, and how  individual identities were being re-interpreted,
  re-configured, and instrumentalized to adapted for automated pattern  matching
  algorithms within the process.

# Review
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pattern matching algorithms — a family of algorithms that seeks to identify 
  similarities 
  between structured data whether in text, images, DNA, or sounds — are foundational of modern computing and are ubiquitous 
  in contemporary societies. Its application ranges from the [payment through smile](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/04/smile-to-pay-chinese-shoppers-turn-to-facial-payment-technology) to the [identification of traffic law violators](https://www.scmp.com/abacus/tech/article/3029548/facial-recognition-enforcing-traffic-laws-shenzhen), from recognizing 
  handwritten characters to DNA sequence matching, from search engine to email spam detection. In a word, it would be hard to 
  imagine the a world without them in 2025. In "Identity Instrumentalized," Aaron Gluck-Thaler offers a compelling glimpse into the Cold War-era development of one such algorithmic strand: facial recognition. Drawing 
  from rich archival 
  resources, he presented a historical epistemology case study centered around mathematician and computer 
  scientist [Woody Bledsoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Bledsoe) (1921 — 1995) and his Panoramic Research Incorporated (PRI) that Bledsoe 
  co-founded with biophysicist [Iben Browning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iben_Browning) (1918 — 1991). Gluck-Thaler 
  meticulously narrated how the PRI and its staff was covertly tasked by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to develop computerized facial recognition programmes,
  specifically focusing on the power dynamics within the cooperation between the CIA and the PRI, as well as Bledsoe's 
  approach to identification, while situating the study in the scholarship of how classification rework the notion of 
  personhood.
  
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gluck-Thaler cautioned that to understand the emergence of facial recognition (as well 
  as other technological advancement), one should consider how scientific knowledge is (socially) produced and 
  epistemologically  conceptualized. He also reminded readers that a genealogical survey of a technology before its present 
  form is usually beneficial , as "Bledsoe's project is part of a longer history[^1] of studying the face through statistics" 
  (p. 1164). The article concluded that amid the unsteady patronage relationship, Bledsoe and his 
  colleagues successfully advanced facial recognition technology, by "\[reinforcing\] a key assumption...that recognizing 
  identity could be reduced to classifying specific features within a set of existing example" (p. 1161). In particular, the 
  researchers reduced all the photographic input into pattern vectors (using scanner) and recorded them; they then use 
  complex mathematical techniques to create (hyper)planes to divide problem space such that different types of vectors 
  belong to different classification. Bledsoe called this method as **feature extraction**. In doing so, they changed the episte-mological underpinning for facial recognition — from recognizing faces to examine the similarity of vectors 
  (vectorization is still a widely-used technique in modern computer science, such as [word embedding](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nlp/word-embeddings-in-nlp/) in Natural Language Processing). Gluck-Thaler fittingly summarized this process "*identity instrumentalized*" for the following reasons:
  
  <div class="indented-list">

  1. A wide range of instruments including RAND Tablets and memory capacities of digital computers shaped their recognition project
  2. The PRI researchers adopted a "instrumentalist orientation to identity, neither asking philosophical questions about it nor defining it theoretically" (p.1166).
  3. In completing the project, Bledsoe and his fellows used "instrumental strategies" for securing fundings for their personal developments.

  </div>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many interesting details in the article, thanks to the existing and 
  declassified rich archival resources, and Gluck-Thaler' scrupulous works. For example, the PRI never publicly reveal that
  they were working for the CIA, but reading through declassified CIA files confirmed that its sponsorship of the PRI; and 
  the CIA was its sole sponsor in 1963! It was also interesting to observe that Bledsoe's problem, identifying a person 
  using a facial photo, is currently [solved and applied widely](https://www.dhs.gov/publication/facial-recognition-technology). Another memorable detail is that Bledsoe was giving a lecture to high school study in 1984 
  (when he was no longer working for the CIA), on the 
  topic of "the social responsibility of science," where he warned that science could be exploited by a Orwellian Big Brother
  to spy on people. If not regarding this act only as hypocrisy, it might reflect a "double-thinking" mentality of Cold War 
  (or beyond) scientists and engineers: on the one hand they passionately worked for increasing their country's defense and 
  intelligence ability, while also cautioned the public about the potentially existing dangers of technologies they 
  unscrupulously created. Their moral reckoning, it seems, often came after their paycheck for patriotism.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, there is one element mentioned in the article (might) invite further research. Gluck-Thaler mentioned that 
  during the project of facial recognition, Bledsoe was tasked to develop mathematical methods to achieve classification, 
  while his co-investigator anthropologist [Christy G. Turner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christy_G._Turner_II) was 
  instructed to " 'collect a fairly large sample of existing measurements' on facial structure \[of difference races\]" (p. 
  1181). This revealed at 
  least two intriguing facts: first, racialist paradigm in anthropology was prevalent in the 1960s, and anthropological 
  knowledge could be used for surveillance or imperialist aims; second, the collaboration between computer scientist and 
  anthropologists (or "social scientists" overall) might not be rare. Numerous scholarship had pointed 
  out the colonial-imperial legacies of anthropology, while few had explored the collaborative paradigm between 
  anthropologists and other scientist under the direction of (say) intelligence community. Moreover, as more (Western)
  anthropologists moved further to the political Left, how did the decoupling of anthropology and other sciences happened. 

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, the article is not only narratively rich but epistemologically insightful. That said, it might have been clearer on the specific epistemic commitments underpinning Bledsoe’s methods, for instance, how they related to broader debates in statistics, AI, or operationalism.
